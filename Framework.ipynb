    "# Deep Learning Frameworks Notes\n",
    "\n",
    "## What is a Deep Learning Framework?\n",
    "- A **software library/tool** with APIs, abstractions, and tools to simplify building and training deep learning models.\n",
    "- Helps in **data processing** and training for **accurate predictive analysis**.\n",
    "- Focuses on **neural network creation**, allowing engineers to tackle complex ML tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deep learning frameworks are interfaces, libraries, or tools (often open-source) that simplify the implementation of **machine learning (ML)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. These frameworks help users upload data, train models, and perform **predictive analysis**, even without deep knowledge of ML or AI.\n",

    "\n",
    "## 1. **TensorFlow**\n",
    "- **Overview**: Open-source, developed by Google in 2015 for internal research, later made public.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Uses **dataflow graphs** for computations.\n",
    "  - Processes inputs as **tensors** (multi-dimensional arrays).\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  - **Text-Based Apps**: Language detection, sentiment analysis.\n",
    "  - **Image Recognition**: Motion and facial recognition systems.\n",
    "  - **Video Detection**: Real-time object tracking from video/image data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. **PyTorch**\n",
    "- **Overview**: Developed in 2016 by Facebook AI Lab; supports both **Python** and **C++**.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Uses **dynamic computational graphs** (on-the-fly computation).\n",
    "  - Supports GPU-powered tensor operations.\n",
    "  - Simplifies building **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**.\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  - **Weather Forecasting**: Pattern detection in datasets.\n",
    "  - **Text Auto Detection**: Auto-suggestions in search engines.\n",
    "  - **Fraud Detection**: Identifies anomalous credit/debit card behavior.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. **Keras**\n",
    "- **Overview**: High-level, open-source library designed for fast prototyping and experimentation.\n",
    "- **Key Features**:\n",
    "  - Acts as a **wrapper** for TensorFlow or Theano.\n",
    "  - Scalable and cross-platform compatibility.\n",
    "  - Written in **Python** for ease of use.\n",
    "- **Applications**:\n",
    "  - **Smartphones**: Integration of ML for intelligent systems (e.g., Apple's advancements).\n",
    "  - **Healthcare**: Predictive diagnosis systems and heart disease detection.\n",
    "  - **Face Mask Detection**: Systems for COVID-19 safety measures.\n",
